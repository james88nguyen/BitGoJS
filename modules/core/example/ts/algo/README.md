# Consolidate Account

This functionality is intended for Algorand only. Account consolidation allows for funds
on receive addresses to be transferred to the wallet address for sending.

### Build + Send

[Build+Send](./account-consolidations-build.ts) allows for some inspection of a consolidation transaction before it is broadcasted.

### Send

[Send](./account-consolidations.ts) is intended as a simple example for the account consolidations feature.
